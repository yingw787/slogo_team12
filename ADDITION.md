#SLogo Addition, Sharrin Manor

##Estimation
- how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
  
  a few hours
  
- how many files will you need to add or update? Why?

  Just one, because everything front end based is in just one big GUI class. It's kind of a messy disaster.

##Review

- how long did it take you to complete this new feature?
It took less than two hours. 

- did you get it completely right on the first try?

No. It took some fudging around but I do have it working successfully. The enw view doesnt update and needs to be closed and reopened when new turtles are created, but besides that it works just fine.

- how many files did you need to add or update? Why?

Just the one GUI class. It is a massive ugly class, but it was very easy for me to add a new view button that pops up a screen, and since there is a master list of the turtles, it was easy to use that list.
All I had to do was contained in one method. 

##Analysis

- what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?

It was nice to see how all the pieces I needed to make this work were already available to me which indicated the design wasn't that bad and I just had to add one method. However, the fact that everyhting is in one giant class was appalling and I have grown a lot since that assignment.
The documentation is definitely lacking.

- was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?

It was probably a bit worse than I remembered, just because it is way too messy and cramped (the front end part at least). 

- what could be improved?

I definitely should have broken my GUI class into sub component classes without a doubt. 
And also the oberserver realtionships I attempted to use seemed ineffective. The connectivity between parts needs to be better.

- what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?

It would have taken much much much longer. I had a vague recollection that the list of turtles was available and figured that is all I would really need to add the front end addition. 
However, knowing exactly where to put the button and how to use the Turtle objects is extremely unclear and we should have had clearer code and documentation.
